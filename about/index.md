Hi, I'm Sean.

I'm a creative person and [sjm.io](http://sjm.io/) is my playground&mdash;a repository for all the fun things that I dream about, discover, and construct.  I am curious by nature and love to explore.  Among many other offline activities I particularly enjoy riding Motorcycles and chasing cloud-base in my Falcon 3 170 Hang Glider.  I primarily fly in-and-around the _Point of the Mountain Flight Park_ in central Utah.  My online interests include:

* Distributed Systems
